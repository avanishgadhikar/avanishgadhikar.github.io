# Hey There, I am Avanish Gadhikar


## About Me
I am an undergrad student at the Indian Institute of Technology majoring in Mathematics and Computing and a minor in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. 
I love to code, solve problems and work on exciting new projects.
I am interested in Finance, Software Engineering, core C++ and much more..!

Otherwise, I would love to talk about sport, music and TV shows. I am an avid footballer and a keen F1 fan.

## Education
* Loyola High School
* Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati

## Projects
You can find some projects I built as a part of my courses and in my spare time here:

* [SegFault Compiler](https://github.com/avanishgadhikar/SegFault-A-compiler-from-scratch.):
  * A C based compiler from scratch, using x86 assembly handling arithmetic, logical operations, loops and conditionals.
  * Implemented a lexer for tokenization and a parser for constructing parse trees using context free grammar.
  * Designed a code generator to convert parse trees into assembly, that successfully compiles programs like FizzBuzz.
* [Plant Disease Detection](https://github.com/aaditya-jalan/plant_disease_detection):
  * Constructed an image classification model using pre-trained VGG16 model employing transfer learning techniques.
  * Analysed 54603 images in color and grayscale format spanning 14 plant species and 38 plant disease classes.
  * Deployed the TensorFlow model using ReactJS as a web-based application enabling real-time classification of photos.
* [Automated Research Paper Categorization](https://github.com/avanishgadhikar/Kriti_24):
  * Designed a solution for the Multi-Label Classification NLP problem encompassing 57 classes.
  * Devised an ensemble strategy by fine-tuning DistilBERT and RoBERTa to enhance the classification process.
* [YouTube Bookmarker Extension](https://github.com/avanishgadhikar/YouTube-Bookmarker-Extension):
  * Developed a Google Chrome extension for YouTube based on the Manifest V3 version of the extension platform.
  * Implemented functionality to save and playback recorded timestamps for a seamless video navigation experience.
* [Stock Prediction Model](https://github.com/avanishgadhikar/Stock-Prediction-Model):
  * Devised an LSTM network model leveraging sequential data, to predict Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price movements.
  * Trained the model on different timescales, analysed strong short term predictions and long term limitations.
